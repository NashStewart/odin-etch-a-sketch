# Odin Etch-a-Sketch

An in-browser Etch-a-Sketch toy project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch)

Move your mouse around the canvas to draw. Pixels are random colors with high opacity.
Each time the curser moves over a pixel, the pixel opacity decreases creating a shading effect.

Clear the canvas or regenerate the canvas of varying sizes.
